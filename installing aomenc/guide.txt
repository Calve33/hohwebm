For debian/ubuntu, the script "debian.sh" automates this

The process is as following:

1. Make sure you have all the stuff needed to compile the thingy

You need: cmake, make, yasm, gcc, perl
All of those probably have that exact name in your package manager

2. Download the code

git clone --depth 1 https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom

3. Make a target directory

mkdir aom_build

4. Go inside the target and configure

cd aom_build && cmake ../aom

5. Compile and pray

make

6. Make the compiled binary available

sudo cp aomenc /usr/local/bin/aomenc

(and the decoder too, if you want it)
sudo cp aomdec /usr/local/bin/aomdec
